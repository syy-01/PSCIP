This project has implemented and made the PSCIP model open-source, which is used to predict whether a protein can form a protein corona with carbon nanotubes. This method significantly enhances the discrimination ability of adsorption events by integrating the prediction results of random forest (RF), XGBoost, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and support vector machine (SVM). We also systematically compared the performance differences between PSCIP and the above four traditional machine learning models, and provided complete experimental data and evaluation metrics (AUC, Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score).

Data Introduction
The data for this study originated from the experimental results of the Nicholas Ouassil team, which utilized liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to analyze the interaction mechanism between proteins and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The experiment constructed incubation systems of Gt6-SWCNTs and Gt15-SWCNTs in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, quantitatively evaluated the changes in protein binding abundance, and determined whether protein caps were formed based on their relative enrichment or reduction trends in biological fluids (Classification labels: Positive/Negative). After data preprocessing and feature engineering optimization, a protein cap dataset consisting of four types of samples was constructed: Gt6-SWCNTs and Gt15-SWCNTs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.

SHAP Feature Importance Analysis
To gain a deeper understanding of the decision-making mechanism of the model, this project employs the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method to conduct feature importance analysis for PSCIP and the comparison models (RF, XGBoost, GBDT, SVM). SHAP is based on the Shapley value in game theory, quantifying the contribution direction (positive/negative) and intensity of each protein physicochemical feature (such as hydrophobicity index, isoelectric point, carbon nanotube contact area, etc.) to a single prediction result. Through global SHAP analysis, we identified that the hydrophobicity index and surface contact area are the most critical features driving the prediction of protein corona formation, which is highly consistent with the biological physical mechanism. All SHAP visualization results (including feature importance ranking diagrams, dependency diagrams, and single-sample explanation diagrams) are saved in the PSCIP/ directory, and users can directly view them.
