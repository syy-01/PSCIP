This project has implemented and made the PSCIP model open-source, which is used to predict whether a protein can form a protein corona with carbon nanotubes. This method significantly enhances the discrimination ability of adsorption events by integrating the prediction results of random forest (RF), XGBoost, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and support vector machine (SVM). We also systematically compared the performance differences between PSCIP and the above four traditional machine learning models, and provided complete experimental data and evaluation metrics (AUC, Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score).
